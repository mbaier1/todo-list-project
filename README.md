# Welcome to the front end of my Todo List!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Make sure to run off of node version 20.

### To install node 20:
* `nvm install 20`
* `nvm use 20`


## To run the project

* Make sure you are on node 20
* `node -v` to see your version
* in the CLI, `npm install`
* `npm start` or `npm run start`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Important!

### For this to work properly, run the backend program locally as well. See its readme for more details.

### Note: The React code is published [here](https://matthew-baier-todo-list-i6jgpgsxs-matthew-baiers-projects.vercel.app/), but the backend with in-memory db was never published.
